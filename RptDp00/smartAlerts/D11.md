## Domain Report for January 24, 2020


### NOTE: These reports are still being developed!
There may be errors or inconsistencies in these reports-- verify sensor issues with the SOM or other monitoring tools before putting in a trouble ticket. What are displayed as sensor failures or intermittent failures may instead be transient issues in streaming data.
Please provide feedback on the reports on the [ServiceNow Blog](https://neon.service-now.com/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=9b4fbe8adbed734017ecf9041d9619be).

#### Future Improvements: 
 - The option to filter reports by system type 
 - Enhancements to detect issues based on coefficient of variation and range values are planned in the near future.

### CLBJ:

**Atmospheric H2O Isotopes**:
 - Intermittent stream failure (_ppmvFwMoleH2O_ at 63.7% uptime) at hut
 - Intermittent stream failure (_d18OWater_ at 63.7% uptime) at hut
 - Intermittent stream failure (_d2HWater_ at 63.7% uptime) at hut

**ECSE profile sampling pump**:
 - Intermittent assembly failure (22.9%) at hut
 - Intermittent assembly failure (22.9%) at hut, ml-1

 - Assembly failure at hut, ml-4 [2020-01-09*]
 - Intermittent assembly failure (22.9%) at hut, ml-5

**Soil Heat Flux**:
 - Calibration cycle not occurring regularly (CnC issue) at soil plot 1, depth 1- _(A spike in voltage every 3.25 hours, returning to 0, is the expected signal)._ Current data pattern:
