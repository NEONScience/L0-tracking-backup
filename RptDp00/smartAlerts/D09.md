## Domain Report for January 18, 2020


### NOTE: These reports are still being developed!
There may be errors or inconsistencies in these reports-- verify sensor issues with the SOM or other monitoring tools before putting in a trouble ticket. What are displayed as sensor failures or intermittent failures may instead be transient issues in streaming data.
Please provide feedback on the reports on the [ServiceNow Blog](https://neon.service-now.com/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=9b4fbe8adbed734017ecf9041d9619be).

#### Future Improvements: 
 - The option to filter reports by system type 
 - Enhancements to detect issues based on coefficient of variation and range values are planned in the near future.

### DCFS:

**No Data Recieved at HQ**:
 - Site is on and communicating, but there is an issue in the field-to-database pipeline. 

 _*No field action required*. This issue will likely resolve on its own. If the issue persists for more than 5 days, submit a trouble ticket._
