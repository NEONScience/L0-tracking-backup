## Domain Report for January 05, 2020


### NOTE: These reports are still being developed!
There may be errors or inconsistencies in these reports-- verify sensor issues with the SOM or other monitoring tools before putting in a trouble ticket. What are displayed as sensor failures or intermittent failures may instead be transient issues in streaming data.
Please provide feedback on the reports on the [ServiceNow Blog](https://neon.service-now.com/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=9b4fbe8adbed734017ecf9041d9619be).

#### Future Improvements: 
 - The option to filter reports by system type 
 - Enhancements to detect issues based on coefficient of variation and range values are planned in the near future.

## D01

### HARV:

**Precipitation**:
 - Bucket over calibration weight (19.02 kg)-- emptying needed at DFIR

**ECSE profile sampling pump**:
 - Assembly failure at hut [2020-01-04*]
 - Assembly failure at hut, ml-1 [2020-01-04*]
 - Assembly failure at hut, ml-2 [2020-01-04*]
 - Assembly failure at hut, ml-3 [2020-01-04*]
 - Assembly failure at hut, ml-4 [2020-01-04*]
 - Assembly failure at hut, ml-5 [2020-01-04*]
 - Assembly failure at hut, ml-6 [2020-01-04*]

**Soil Heat Flux**:
 - Calibration cycle not occurring regularly (CnC issue) at soil plot 5, depth 1- _(A spike in voltage every 3.25 hours, returning to 0, is the expected signal)._ Current data pattern:
