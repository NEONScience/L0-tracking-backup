## Domain Report for February 15, 2020


### NOTE: These reports are still being developed!
There may be errors or inconsistencies in these reports-- verify sensor issues with the SOM or other monitoring tools before putting in a trouble ticket. What are displayed as sensor failures or intermittent failures may instead be transient issues in streaming data.
Please provide feedback on the reports on the [ServiceNow Blog](https://neon.service-now.com/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=9b4fbe8adbed734017ecf9041d9619be).

#### Future Improvements: 
 - The option to filter reports by system type 
 - Enhancements to detect issues based on coefficient of variation and range values are planned in the near future.

## D20

### PUUM:

**Photosynthetically active radiation (Quantum Line)**:
 - Assembly failure at soil plot 3

**Soil Heat Flux**:
 - Calibration cycle not occurring regularly (CnC issue) at soil plot 3, depth 1- _(A spike in voltage every 3.25 hours, returning to 0, is the expected signal)._ Current data pattern:
